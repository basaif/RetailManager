Application Ideas

* Actually interact with the inventory
* Move API to Azure - Costs Money
* CI/CD Process = continuous integration: whenever you check in code, it makes sure it works with the rest;
and continuous deployment: whenever you check in code, it deploys it somewhere.
* Deploy Desktop App to Blob Storage for download
* Introduce a web-based inventory control system (Blazor)
* Web-based reporting
* A Xamairn Forms app for a mobile register

Phase 2 Roadmap

1. Take advantage of .NET Core
2. Set up a simple Task board in Azure DevOps
2. CI/CD with Azure DevOPs (move source code to Azure DevOps?) you don't have to move it
3. Move API to Azure
4. Move the database to Azure SQL
5. Deploy the Desktop app the Azure Blob Storage (Blob means file system) (not free)
6. Web-based inventory control system
